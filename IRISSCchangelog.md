# Iris/Oculus For Simple Clouds

Official Beta Release: with Distant Horizons now supported I can safely say that this mod is in beta. There may still be some bugs, but the core functionality is there.
Next update will focus on compatibility with immersive engineering and fixing the cloud shadow map issue with the shader.
